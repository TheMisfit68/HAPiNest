/// the PLC-Object that has the same name as the accessory and that will act as the final AccessoryDelegate.
///
/// Also most of the functionality that is normally required for an AccessoryDelegate
/// is already implemented by the PLC and the PLC-Classes by default,
/// making large parts of the protocol optional.
